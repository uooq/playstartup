Yay, your installation looks good!

This is a rather hideous, hand-crafted html page that Play! is serving up without doing any meddling (i.e. no server-side
templates going on, just passing back this page as is). I made this work at the "/" root by by editing the conf/routes file
but it's also served at /public/html/index.html

This project is kind of a general-purpose sampler that I'm using to figure out how to wire up things like database integration,
coffeescript compilation, etc. Rather than wiring up everything in one end-to-end experience, I am trying to create
individual entry points for each feature. Here's stuff to look at:

<ul>
    <li><a href="/autogen/">Documentation:</a> The original, auto-generated, home page that gets generated by Play!</li>
    <li><a href="/public/html/irequirecoffee.html">Hello Coffeescript!</a> Super simple page that shows how to wire up in-browser coffeescript compilation</li>
</ul>
