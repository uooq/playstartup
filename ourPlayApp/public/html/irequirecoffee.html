        This page makes use of code written in coffeescript and uses a library called requirejs for enabling module
        loading and coffeescript compilation. Big disclaimer: this is not an example of good use of require or coffeescript,
        just a way to show how client-side coffeescript compilation can happen.

        <p />

        The only script included in this page is require.js but it also passes along a parameter for irequirecoffee/main.js
        to a script which handles subsequent script dependencies. <p/>

        So here it is: click the button to execute some coffeescript:

        <input type="button" value="Click Me, Click Me!" id="theButton" />
    </body>
